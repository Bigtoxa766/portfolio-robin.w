      <p>Skillset</p>
      <p>With skills in over 4 different fields of design, I am the perfect person to hire when it comes to a full fledged
      project. Whatever your needs are, I can pretty much take on any challenge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Product Design</h2>
          <p>Working at Facebook has taught me a lot about how to understand users, solve problems and build great products.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Visual Design</h2>
          <p>My experience at dribbble has helped me learn to develop the eye for design. Colors, typography, layout and the whole
          package.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Motion Design</h2>
          <p>I started my design journey with motion design in my college days. Motion is something that really fascinates me because
          of the flexibility of story telling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Photography</h2>
          <p>Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography really makes you look and percieve things in a
          different way.</p>
